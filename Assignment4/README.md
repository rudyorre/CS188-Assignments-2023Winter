# Assignment 4

Welcome to the final assignment for CS188 Computer Vision course! 

We are pleased that you have made it this far and are excited to see what you will accomplish in this last challenge.

## Notice

This assignment is meant to be exploratory and is designed to be relatively straightforward compared to previous assignments. Our goal is to provide you with an opportunity to review and apply the concepts you have learned so far in a more flexible and creative manner, while also allowing you to focus on your project and prepare for the upcoming finals.

We encourage you to think critically and creatively as you work through this assignment, and to use this opportunity to dive deeper into the material we have covered. As always, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to the course staff. We are here to support you throughout the process.

Best of luck with the rest of the quarter!

### Access
Assignment 4 has been released and can be accessed via the Colab link [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yLCzioaemotm7OmTel28VB1fzYtFIKJv?usp=sharing).


## Goals
In this assignment, you will have the opportunity to explore three topics in deep learning applications:

1. Semantic Segmentation and Instance Segmentation (Object Detection + Segmentation)
2. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
3. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs)

Through this assignment, you will gain experience in applying existing codebases for semantic segmentation and object detection, and you will explore the StyleGAN2 model, InterfaceGAN, and GAN inversion techniques for image generation. Additionally, you will delve into the concept of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and use them to represent a single large image with a neural network. Finally, you will explore advanced topics related to neural radiance fields.

***Don't be intimidated by the number of topics listed here as you will not be required to implement all of them. Your task will be to apply existing codebases and gain hands-on experience with these models.***

As always, please feel free to post any questions or issues you encounter on the Piazza forum. And remember, please do not directly copy code from other sources.

This assignment is due on Wednesday, March 15th. Best of luck with your work!

‚ùóOnce you have finished all the questions, note that it may take approximately 1 hour to re-run the entire notebook to prepare the submission version. Make sure to allocate enough time for this task and start early.

**Do not use any Code AI to finish the assignment.**

Good luck and happy coding! Remember, the most important thing is to have fun and learn something new.
